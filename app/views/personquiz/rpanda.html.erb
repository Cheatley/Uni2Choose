        <p>You’re energetic and playful. You may appear to be lost in your own world at times but really you’re contemplating everything going on around you. You live life like Michelangelo looking for the sculpture in every stone. You are fascinated by new ideas and developments in fields you are interested in and enjoy working with people. All you want from work is to pursue and explore new ideas and concepts. You favour work environments with little regimentation and no hierarchy which makes working as a consultant viable.
          These qualities make you best suited to jobs where you can explore new ideas and push boundaries. Where you can interact with people.
