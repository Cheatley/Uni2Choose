    I change during the course of a day. I wake and I'm one person, and when I go to sleep I know for certain I'm somebody else.

ISFP personality types are true artists, but not necessarily in the typical sense where they're out painting happy little trees. Often enough though, they are perfectly capable of this. Rather, it's that they use aesthetics, design and even their choices and actions to push the limits of social convention. ISFPs enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behavior â€“ chances are, they've expressed more than once the phrase "Don't box me in!"</p>
